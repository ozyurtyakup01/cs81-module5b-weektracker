Were your predictions accurate?
Yes
What surprised you about your week?
Nothing, I made up the data. Didn't spend time tracking what i did during the week
Which higher order function was most useful and why?
All reduce the code, down to couple lines. Because I used reduce() only for accumulated result I would say filter and map were better. Using plain for loop would be less confusing and more revealing for myself but i'll get used to those
